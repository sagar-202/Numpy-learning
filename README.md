cd Numpy-learning
pip install numpy


🧠 Notes

You can add your key learnings and mistakes in:

notes/reflections.md


Example:

### Array Creation
- Learned about `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`
- Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Broadcasting simplified repetitive operations

 Add your first notebook on array creation

 Commit and push changes

 Keep updating progress table weekly

## 🧠 Step 3: Start Adding Notebooks
Once you create your first Jupyter notebook (`01_array_creation.ipynb`), add and push it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add array creation notebook"
git push
